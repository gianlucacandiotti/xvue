# xVue

This is an Express template I plan to use for my own projects. It's still work in proggress but you can check it out.

## Why did you do this ?

## How can I start a project using this ?

## How can I start coding with everything you have mentioned ?

These are the tasks included in the template. I'll just copy most of the descriptions from the [Vuejs Webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) since this is the template I merged with Express. If you want to know anything else about the tasks, about the folder structure or how to change or extend anything refer to their [docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/).

- `npm run dev`: First-in-class development experience.
  - Start developing by going into your browser and hitting `APP_URL:8080`.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
  - Source maps

- `npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - All static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and a production `base.blade.php` is auto-generated with proper URLs to these generated assets.

- `npm run unit`: Unit tests run in PhantomJS with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) + [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) + [karma-webpack](https://github.com/webpack/karma-webpack).
  - Supports ES2015 in test files.
  - Supports all webpack loaders.
  - Easy mock injection.

## So, anything else ?

Not really. I'd just want to thank you for giving it a try or at least reading through. If you have any feedback it'd be greatly appreciated. I bet a lot of things could be improved and I'm open to discussion, so open an issue, send a pull request or message me to gianluca.prwlr@gmail.com.
